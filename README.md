A Quick Brief on React Native

React Native is a recently launched framework used for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript. In a nutshell, the main idea behind using React Native is to create an application that seamlessly runs on multiple platforms. The logic behind writing an entire application in Javascript is you donâ€™t need to use two separate programming languages for Android/iOS.

In other words, React Native is a cross-platform app development framework that allows you to write code once, and deploy it to both platforms including iOS and Android.
